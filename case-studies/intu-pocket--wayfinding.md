<!-- The map itself isn't required for wayfinding essentially functioned as a 'landmark' screen,
like a menu or homepage,
that users would use as a jumping-off point.-->

<!--It made sense that the user's mental modal for navigating the app was the map, because the app is a representation of the information of a physical space, and maps are how we navigate physical spaces.-->

<!--looked to different mapping solutions to figure out how best to empower this behaviour, covering mobile maps, SatNav, physical maps and even video game minimaps.<!-- travel time maps -->
<!--I delivered an evolution of the minimap because it allowed the user to use other content without leaving the map context, I ran with this principle of a 'passive' map and map-as-menu. Minimap idea, pinch & zoom to nav, get deeper into stores and centres etc.-->
