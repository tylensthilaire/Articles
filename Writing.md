# Editing

Although you can edit a gist using the online editor, 
it's rare that you would want to 
except for the most minor edits. 
For longer edits you'll want to clone the gist (copy it to your computer) 
and edit it from there using your preferred text editor (e.g. GitHub's [Atom](https://atom.io)). 

GitHub makes version control easy with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). 
You might want to practice a little bit 
and do some background reading on the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for versioning, 
but you'll be up and running in to time.

GitHub's version control works by comparing differences (diffs) 
between lines in an old and new version of a document. 
This works really great for code, 
but isn't ideal for spoken languages 
because we typically write entire paragraphs on one line 
'soft-wrapping' the line when we run out of horizonal space. 
When comparing diffs 
editing one word would show an entire paragraph as changed 
making it hard to compare specific edits.

The workaround for this 
is to use a technique called '[semantic linefeeding](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/)'; 
by splitting sentences down 
into natural clauses and thoughts 
it becomes easy to see changes on each line 
and move ideas around. 
Semantic linefeeds will break your writing down 
into an almost poetic form 
which apart from looking quite beautiful 
will also help you isolate your important thoughts 
and simplify your language. 
Markdown and Semantic Linefeeds work perfectly together 
(despite being created in the 70's and 00's respectively) 
so you won't need to reformat your text, 
Markdown will transform it all back into paragraphs.
