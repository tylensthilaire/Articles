\f0\fs28 \cf0 The case is made for not just a return to leftism but perhaps a flirtation with a Nordic-style Social democracy. Indeed many of the actions the UK government have taken are straight out of Jeremy Corbyn\'92s playbook. A man who, in his own words, was \'93{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://93990E0E-BF68-4ABE-AEF1-630B356056C0"}}{\fldrslt denounced as somebody that wanted to spend more money than we could possibly afford}}\'94. The UK has been under the effects of a government austerity programme for over a decade now, and as a result has sees {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://F57CBE1F-0C47-4E3F-937D-CFE50A1A5C96"}}{\fldrslt more crime, more poverty and food bank usage}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://58CE1D1A-427E-4771-BDF5-405D96CBD3EA"}}{\fldrslt excess mortality}} to the tune of 120,000 people and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://45085651-9193-40BE-843D-99D47E4DFBE2"}}{\fldrslt increased homelessness}}.

With the need for social policies laid bare the political landscape shifted accordingly. We\'92ve seen a future with truly nationalised healthcare, increased welfare, even the end of homelessness, but only because the powerful were affected. Voters will need long memories to ensure what we have been given is not taken away once again.}
