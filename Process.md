1. Create a Gist/Repo or clone from a template 
  * Gists can be used with a free account to keep things secret but lack file uploads or folder structures
1. Create a main file, this is where the final article will be written.
  * All content is written in markdown
  * Github Flavour Markdown is best for Github
  * Multimarkdown has more features and doesn't conflict with GFM
1. Add YAML frontmatter to the main file
 * This is always useful but extra useful if you want to create a GitHub site and use the Jeckyll prefefined variables
1. Add all research/references to a reference file
1. Create an outline file and list things to say
1. When writing, create a new file for each 'section'
  * Learned from using Scrivener, you can easily edit 'scrivening' separately and reorder it for the final manuscript
  * Use semantic linebreaks when writing, makes it easier to see changes and Markdown renders it in a human-readable manner
1. Edit locally with an editor of your choice
  * Lightpaper, Atom are good choices but Typora renders flowchart, sequence and mermaid diagrams which is a killer feature
1. Send back to github for version control
1. Use semantic versioning when updating
1. If using a Gist, merge to Repo when ready to go public
1. Raise issues to work on or let other people raise issues
  * When using other people's issues, take their issue as a requirement and create a new issue of your own in the correct format. Link back to the original issue(s) that prompted the change.
