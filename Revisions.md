# Revisions

Once your work is published 
you can continue to revise it, 
Particularly for any public repos, 
GitHub makes this very easy. 
Readers can raise an issue to suggest improvements 
or fork your repo to make their own, 
which you can merge back into master.

Managing issues can be tricky if there are too many
and they're not fully fleshed out. 
The best way to manage these is to 
create a new issue for yourself 
that references the issue(s) that sparked the idea 
and close the originals. 
That keeps the issue under your control 
but still acknowledges the original contributor.
