# Advanced GitHub For Writers

* Semantic Versioning
* Command Line Stuff
* GitFlow?
* Issues and Pull Requests



Managing issues can be tricky if there are too many
and they're not fully fleshed out. 
The best way to manage these is to 
create a new issue for yourself 
that references the issue(s) that sparked the idea 
and close the originals. 
That keeps the issue under your control 
but still acknowledges the original contributor.

Once your work is published 
you can (and should) continue to revise it, 
GitHub makes this particularly easy for public repos. 
Readers can raise an issue to suggest improvements 
or fork (create a copy of) your repo to make their own changes, 
which you can merge back into master.



Markdown files can be created in _any_ text editor, 
so you don't need any special software 
and you won't be locked in to Google or Microsoft. 
Just name any text file you create like so, `file-name.md`, 
and you're all set, 
you can even do it right from GitHub. 

Although you can edit files online directly, 
for longer edits you'll want to do it locally, 
in a nice text editor 
such as [Lightpaper](https://getlightpaper.com), [Typora](https://typora.io) or GitHub's own [Atom](https://atom.io).
But first you'll need to download (clone) and sync 
your files to your computer 
using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com),
just find the clone url, hit 'Clone Repository' 
and you're ready to go.
