# GitHub For Better Writers

* Writing techniques



Every technological advance paves the way for the ideas that come next and GitHub and Markdown are no different. Writing is often a process of writing and rewriting your ideas from beginning to end in various 'drafts' which is rarely how the brain works.

GitHub makes it easy to break manuscripts into 
several small documents for each topic or section 
and to keep your outline, research, references, etc, close by,
so that you can get a bird's eye view of your writing 
and manage them in isolation. 
Changing to a non-linear mindset 
lets you get ideas down as soon as inspiration strikes, 
so your manuscript grows as organically as your thoughts do 
and the freedom to restructure your document on the fly, 
or to completely polish one section while others languish, 
without the subconscious pressure to perfect as you go 
and to remember ideas for later 
will free up your mind for _more creativity_.
When you're finished, 
simply copy-paste everything into one document 
and delete the files you don't need.

Pure Markdown is enough for most people 
but if you find it lacks features you need 
you might find them in other 'flavours' of Markdown.
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (GFM) is popular for obvious reasons, 
but [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) has more features suited to professional writing, 
such as footnotes and references.

After your final draft is complete 
I recommend combing though the manuscript 
to remove all nonessential phrases 
– made easier by the semantic linefeeds – 
and running it through [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com). 
Hemingway will highlight writing _faux pas_ 
and estimate a 'Reading Grade' 
(WCAG SC 3.1.5 anyone?) <!-- Link missing -->
but its dedication to functionalism can sound mechanical, 
don't let the SatNav tell you to drive into a lake.
