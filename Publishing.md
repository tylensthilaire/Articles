# Publishing

Once your manuscript is completed, 
you'll likely need to export it into a format you can use elsewhere. 
Many CMSs will let you copy and paste Markdown 
right into the content field for digital publishing 
but the format will depend on the specific output. 
[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) is a great tool, 
described as a 'Swiss Army knife' for document conversion. 
You could even make use of 'continuous integration' 
and have your text compiled to multiple formats 
and deployed to multiple outputs 
with every merge to master.

If you're publishing directly to GitHub Pages 
you just need to make sure your post conforms to the Jekyll standards 
and either import your gist to the right repo and/or push your changes to master.
