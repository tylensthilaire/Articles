# GitHub For Writers

GitHub normally used for managing code 
across large teams, 
but it's just as good at managing your writing 
for the same reasons: 
it's available anywhere, 
collaboration is built in 
and it has change tracking at it's core.

Sure, 
it's not as frictionless as Google Docs 
but it allows for a looser writing flow 
and it's methodical process 
can actually help you improve your writing, 
the same way *shisa kanko* (pointing and calling)
